// No raw control characters in source — the single-file builds depend on it.
//
// `vite-plugin-singlefile` inlines the whole bundle into a `<script>` inside
// index.html, and HTML tokenisation replaces a literal U+0000 with U+FFFD
// (WHATWG 13.2.5, "Preprocessing the input stream"). Any code that carried a
// literal NUL therefore arrives at the JS parser mangled.
//
// That is not a cosmetic difference. `usePlayerIdentity.cleanName` had its
// control-character class written with LITERAL characters rather than `\u`
// escapes, so in the GamePix build the class became
// `[\ufffd-\u001f...]` -- a range out of order, which throws at regex PARSE time, which means the entire
// bundle fails to evaluate. The game sat on the splash at 0% and nothing in
// the build output hinted at it. The dev server and every multi-file build
// keep the byte intact and are completely unaffected, which is exactly why it
// shipped.
//
// So: assert on the SOURCE, since that is where the fix has to live. A future
// edit that pastes a literal control character back in fails here rather than
// in a portal's QA queue.
