// The portal mute has to stop music that has not STARTED yet.
//
// This pins the exact flow portal QA runs and the exact way the obvious
// implementation fails it (Playgama filed it against tower-siege after the
// initial-state read was already in place):
//
//   1. the portal is muted, and the player RELOADS;
//   2. the SDK reports "muted" during boot, before any audio element exists;
//   3. `setPlatformAudioMuted(true)` suspends an audio layer that is still
//      empty — there is nothing to pause, so nothing happens;
//   4. a second later the run starts and `startBattleMusic()` plays.
//
// Every mid-session test passes and the graded one fails. The fix is that the
// mute is a REACTIVE ref the music start READS (`playWithFade`), not an edge it
// is merely notified of — plus the false-edge re-fire, without which a player
// who unmutes gets a permanently silent game.
//
// The assertion is on `HTMLMediaElement.prototype.play` call COUNTS, which is
// the same thing the real-browser check counts, so the two agree.
