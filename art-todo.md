# Art todo — drop-in manifest

glyphyx draws **everything** from code: the survivors and the monster cast
are hand-inked vector art baked to frame strips at runtime, and the lane, gates,
crates, rounds and effects are Canvas 2D. Nothing below is required for the game
to ship — each entry is an *optional upgrade* that replaces a procedural drawing
with a painting, with **no code change**: drop the file at the exact path,
switch the art layer on, and the renderer picks it up. A missing or
still-decoding file always falls back to the drawing.

**Every path here is produced by the art pipeline** rather than by hand — see
[`art-sheets/README.md`](./art-sheets/README.md). The `/art-sheets` bench
exports a reference sheet and a master prompt per entry, an image model paints
it in the dark-fantasy register, and `pnpm slice-sheets` cuts the return back to
the path, registered against the drawing it replaces. The manifest that owns
this table is `src/game/artSheet.ts`; the runtime catalogue is
`src/game/artCatalogue.ts`; a test keeps the two in step.

Format for everything: **WebP**, sRGB, premultiplied alpha, at the size the
slicer caps it to: **256 px tall per frame** by default, or the manifest's
`maxEdge` where that is smaller. The logo is PNG, at the 512 its PWA icon needs.

**Nothing may read fixed pixel offsets out of one of these files.** The size
above is a payload decision and it changes; the reference sizes in `artSheet.ts`
are the shape the sheet is PAINTED at, not the shape it is written at. The gate
frame's nine-slice cut at `GATE_FRAME`'s own 1344x576 and lost its right-hand
post entirely the first time the gates were re-sliced at the default cap — the
cut simply started past the end of a 597 px file. Slice by FRACTION of the
bitmap that arrived, the way `paintGateFrame` and `blitBanner` both do now.

**The paintings are OFF by default.** `spriteFor()` probes nothing until
`?art=on` (remembered per device) or `VITE_ENABLE_ART_OVERRIDES=true` in the
build's env — a portal's QA console reports every missed probe as a broken
resource, so the flag stays off in every `.env.<platform>` until the art is in.

## Walk cycles (strips: N panels side by side, one locomotion cycle)

| Path | Subject | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `public/images/monsters/<design>.webp` | each of the 13 designs in `monsters.ts` | Played from the same clock as the bake, so the swap is seamless mid-stride. Authored facing as the bake does; the field mirrors by travel. Frame count is read off the strip's shape. |
| `public/images/heroes/<outfit>.webp` | the survivor, ×3 (`teal`, `amber`, `violet`) | Seen from BEHIND; the outfit's coat colour is its identity in the crowd. |

## Deliberately NOT bitmaps

* **The road tile** — a painted cobble tile was tried through the pipeline and
  was worse than the drawing: stones big enough to read at all read as objects
  under the crowd, and the ground must never compete with what stands on it.
  `paintLaneTile` in `useSurvivalArt.ts` has no probe on purpose.
* **Particles other than the smoke puff** — sparks, shards and dots are a few
  pixels each and tinted per emitter; a painting buys nothing at that size.
* **The gate curtain, the plate, the chevrons, the dismissal debris, the
  vignette, the speed lines** — additive or text-bearing Canvas work that
  animates every frame; a bitmap would only make them heavier or freeze them.
* **The claw furrows, the elite sweep band, the rocket's blast** — telegraphs
  and hits drawn from the simulation's own numbers, and a painting that stayed
  one size would be a lie the player only discovers by dying to it. (The
  rocket ITSELF is painted — it is an object with a fixed size — the blast is
  not.)

## Promo art still needed for store listings
