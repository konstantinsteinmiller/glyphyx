/**
 * ─── glyphyx leaderboard ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A Cloudflare Worker over one D1 table. Two routes:
 *
 *   GET  /top    → the materialised top-100 PLUS the score histogram for the
 *                  whole population, edge-cached for `EDGE_TTL`
 *   POST /score  → upsert one player's best, and return their rank + the board
 *
 * The histogram is what lets the client rank a player EXACTLY without asking:
 * the published rows stop at 100, so on a board of thousands almost everyone is
 * below the cut and could otherwise only be told "#100+".
 *
 * THE SCORE IS THE HIGHEST STAGE REACHED. Not a point total — the game's whole
 * progression is "how deep did you get", so the board is a depth chart and
 * `score` is a small integer that grows by one at a time.
 *
 * Design rules, in the order they matter:
 *
 *   1. The client may never be blocked by this. Every response is fast or the
 *      client's own 6 s timeout gives up and the game carries on with no rank.
 *   2. The free tier is a design constraint, not a footnote. The board is
 *      materialised into ONE row (`board_cache`) so a view costs one row read
 *      instead of a hundred, and the edge cache makes most views cost zero.
 *   3. Trust nothing. The id and name are re-sanitised here even though the
 *      client already did it, and an implausible score is refused outright.
