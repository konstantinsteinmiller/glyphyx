/**
 * ─── Sheet slicer ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The return half of the art pipeline. `/#/art-sheets` bakes the procedural
 * cast onto a 256 px lattice and out to an image model; this takes the
 * repainted sheet and cuts it back into the drop-in bitmaps `spriteFor()`
 * probes for — `public/images/runes/melee-river-lv1.webp` and the rest.
 *
 *   node tools/slice-sheets.mjs art-sheets/painted/sheet-runes-melee.png
 *   pnpm art:slice                         # every image in art-sheets/painted/
 *   pnpm art:slice -- --dry                # print the plan, write nothing
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES TO A PANEL
 *
 * A lattice sheet is cut on the index's rects. Every panel with a target is
 * keyed (magenta → transparent), then NORMALISED onto the reference: the
 * bench recorded where the drawing sat in its panel (`fit`: the solid-pixel
 * box as fractions of the panel), the return is measured the same way, and
 * one scale-and-move puts the painted stone exactly where the drawn one was.
 * The renderer then blits the file into the same box it paints in, and the
 * painting replaces the drawing 1:1 without a scale knob anywhere. A panel
 * the index marks `fill` (a tile, the frame) is trimmed to its own edges
 * instead: it must reach all four sides or it tiles with a seam.
 *
 * WHY IT DRIVES A BROWSER
 *
 * The renderer only ever probes for `.webp`, and Node has no image encoder in
 * the standard library. The choice was a native dependency (`sharp`) in a
 * project that ships to eight portals, or the encoder that is already installed
 * on this machine. Chrome decodes the PNG, crops on a canvas and encodes WebP
 * in three lines — so the pipeline stays dependency-free, and it is the same
 * isolated-profile harness the export bench is driven with.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO
 *
 * The whole contract is that cell N comes back at the pixels cell N went out
 * at. An image model that re-composed the grid produces a file that still looks
 * fine and slices into garbage — every sprite a few pixels off centre, which
 * nobody notices until the board looks subtly wrong. So a sheet whose grid no
 * longer matches the index is REJECTED rather than best-guessed.
 *
 * That test is a SHAPE test, and it is deliberately not a strict one. A return
 * whose proportions drifted a percent — 1456x720 for a 1024x506 sheet — has not
 * re-composed anything: the rects are read per axis (`c.x * sx`, `c.y * sy`),
 * so every panel still lands on its own content and is resampled back to its
 * nominal box on the way out. Refusing that throws away a good generation over
 * arithmetic this file already does for strips and walks. A grid that really
 * WAS re-composed misses by an order of magnitude more (the glyph sheet re-laid
 * from 3 across to 5 came back 19% off), so the threshold separates them
 * cleanly.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO TWICE
 *
 * A painting is a snapshot of a DRAWING, and the drawing moves. The bow was
 * re-cut after its stones were painted, and nothing in the pipeline noticed:
 * `pnpm art:slice` would have cheerfully re-installed twelve stones carrying
 * the old silhouette over the corrected one, silently, on the next run anybody
 * made for an unrelated sheet.
 *
 * So a successful slice leaves a RECEIPT (`painted/.sliced.json`) naming the
 * revision of the reference each file was cut against — the hash of the clean
 * sheet the bench exported. When the reference has changed since, the painting
 * is refused with the reason, because it is now a painting of something else.
 * `--stale-ok` slices it anyway for the cases where the change was cosmetic and
 * the operator knows it.
 *
 * Without a receipt (a fresh clone, a first run) nothing is refused: mtimes
 * after a checkout say nothing, so an older-looking file is a WARNING and the
 * slice goes ahead.

  files            One or more PNGs, or a directory. Defaults to art-sheets/painted/.
  --sheet <id>     Force the target: a sheet (runes-melee, runes-enemy-mage, glyphs,
                   tiles, frame, ui, fx), a walk (bonecap, teal, bolt), a band
                   (ridge-far) or a single (single-melee-river-lv1). Otherwise
                   inferred from the filename, then from the aspect ratio.
  --out <dir>      Where targets are written, relative to the repo. Default: public
  --size <px>      Force a frame's height, in px, for this run. Default: 256,
                   lowered to the sheet's own cap where the index carries a
                   smaller one, raised to the biggest resized copy it ships.
  --quality <0-1>  WebP quality. Default: 0.92
  --no-chroma      Keep a magenta background instead of keying it out.
  --no-auto-bg     Do not flood-fill a uniform background away. Auto-removal
                   handles white, cream and painted-in checkerboards; it is
                   skipped on panels the index marks 'fill' (tiles, the frame),
                   whose borders are artwork.
  --no-trim        Keep a tile's margin instead of cropping it back to its own
                   edges. Tiles must reach all four sides or they sit with a
                   seam, so this is on by default for 'fill' panels.
  --no-fit         Do not normalise a panel onto the reference's measured box.
  --fit squash|crop  How to square up a single-cell image that came back
                   non-square. squash (default) keeps every feature and
                   distorts; crop keeps proportions and loses the edges.
  --frames <n>     Accept a walk sheet that came back with n panels instead of
                   the 8 it was asked for, and play them as one cycle. Must
                   match the grid the slicer measured.
  --stale-ok       Slice a painting whose reference has been REDRAWN since it
                   was painted. Off by default: the receipt in
                   painted/.sliced.json is what stops a re-cut rune quietly
                   getting its old silhouette back on the next unrelated run.
  --size <px>      See above. 256 is the rule (LOADING.md, payload sizing).
  --dry            Print the plan and write nothing.
