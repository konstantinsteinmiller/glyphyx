/**
 * A painting's URL for the DOM side of the game, or `null` while the drawing
 * stands in.
 *
 * The field asks `spriteFor` per drawable per frame and gets an image or
 * nothing; a Vue template cannot poll, so this is the same probe as a ref:
 * it re-reads when a file decodes or the flag flips (`onArtChanged`) and the
 * `<img>` or `border-image` bound to it swaps in the same tick. With the art
 * layer off it stays `null` and not one request is made — the same contract
 * every painter on the field keeps.
