/**
 * ─── glyphyx audio ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two sources, one entry point (`playFx`):
 *
 *   SAMPLES   — where a recorded sound is unmistakably better: coin pickup,
 *               stage-clear fanfare, the wipe sting. These route through the
 *               shared `useSound` fast path (decoded AudioBuffers).
 *   SYNTHESIS — the whole combat layer. A crowd of forty fires ~46 shots a
 *               second; sample playback of one file at that rate sounds like a
 *               machine gun jam, and shipping forty variants would bloat the
 *               download. Shots, impacts, gate ticks and bursts are synthesised
 *               per event with randomised pitch and envelope, so no two are
 *               identical and the combat mix costs zero bytes.
 *
 * The gate tick is the one cue the whole game is built around, so it gets
 * special treatment: its pitch RISES with the gate's value. Pumping a gate from
 * +1 to +12 plays an ascending scale, which is why holding fire on a gate feels
 * like winding something up rather than waiting.
 *
 * Everything runs on the SHARED AudioContext from `useAssets`, which the ad /
 * pause gate suspends — so "no game audio during an ad" covers synthesised
 * sound for free: a suspended context produces silence.
