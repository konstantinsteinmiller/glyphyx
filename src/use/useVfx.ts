 * ─── VFX: pooled particles, floating text, decals, quality tiers ─────────────
 *
 * The domain never touches pixels: a resolution is a list of time-stamped
 * events (`ResolveEvent` in `rules.ts`) and the renderer (`useArenaArt`)
 * turns each one into the particles, text, shake and sound it deserves. This
 * module is the pool those effects are drawn from, plus the FPS-driven quality
 * controller every renderer pass reads.
 *
 * Coordinates are whatever the caller projects with: the arena renderer works
 * in CSS pixels with y DOWN, so it emits with the y axis flipped (world y =
 * -screen y) and projects back with `toY = (wy) => -wy`. That keeps gravity a
 * positive number and the spark streaks pointing along their velocity.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE: particles live in flat typed arrays with a swap-remove free
 * list, so a 400-particle gate burst allocates nothing. Draw order is bucketed
 * by blend mode, so the canvas switches `globalCompositeOperation` exactly
 * twice per frame instead of once per particle.

 * The hold exists to stop a device sitting on a threshold from oscillating, and
 * oscillation needs both directions. A downgrade that has to wait 2.5 s for
 * permission is 2.5 s of a player at 15 fps, and it cannot start a cycle on its
