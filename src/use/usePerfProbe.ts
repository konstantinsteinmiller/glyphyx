// ─── In-page performance probe ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Percentiles of work-per-frame and RAF interval, long-task count and heap
// slope, published on `window.__perf` for the A/B runner (`scripts/perf-ab.mjs`)
// to read back. See `PERF-LEDGER.md` for the procedure.
//
// ── Why percentiles and not mean fps ──
//
// Mean fps is dominated by the good frames. A device alternating 8 ms and 60 ms
// frames averages out looking fine and feels awful; the number that matches the
// felt experience is the tail. So the probe keeps the distribution and reports
// p50/p95/p99, and the primary metric is p95 work-per-frame.
//
// ── Why work-per-frame AND interval ──
//
// Work-per-frame is the time inside your own update+draw: it is what an
// optimization actually moves, and it stays meaningful when the loop is
// vsync-capped and every interval reads 16.7 ms. But it is CPU-side only, so a
// change that trades CPU for GPU can improve it while the game gets worse. The
// RAF interval is what absorbs GPU backpressure. Neither alone is safe; the
// runner reports both, and a "win" that improves work while regressing interval
// is not a win.
//
// ── Cost when off ──
//
// Disabled by default and resolved once at boot. Every entry point is then a
// call that reads one `const` boolean and returns, which V8 inlines away. When
// ON, the hot path writes into preallocated `Float64Array` ring buffers and
// allocates nothing; sorting happens only when the summary is read.
//
// Enable with `?perfprobe=1` or `localStorage.setItem('perfprobe', 'true')`.
