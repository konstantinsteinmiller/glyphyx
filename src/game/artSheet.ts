/**
 * ─── Art sheet manifest ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * glyphyx draws everything procedurally, which is wonderful for payload and
 * useless for one specific job: handing the art to somebody — or something —
 * that paints. There is no folder of PNGs to send. This module describes the
 * REFERENCE SHEETS that bake the whole cast out of the renderer, so the art can
 * leave, be repainted in a dark-fantasy hand, and come back in as drop-ins.
 *
 * Two shapes of sheet:
 *
 *   WALKS   a grid of panels showing one creature through one locomotion
 *           cycle. Each panel is the bake's own frame box scaled up, so a
 *           painted strip drops straight back in with the feet on the same
 *           line and nothing downstream has to be told where they are.
 *   STILLS  one object per image. A still is a one-frame walk to the slicer,
 *           which is what gives every prop, round and effect the same fit
 *           step the creatures get: the return is measured against the
 *           reference and normalised onto it, so a crate painted with a
 *           polite margin still fills its box in play.
 *
 * THE BOX IS THE CONTRACT. Every still is drawn by the renderer's OWN painter
 * (`useSurvivalArt`) into exactly the rectangle the renderer blits the
 * painting back into. Get the bench and the runtime out of step and every
 * painted part is the wrong size, everywhere, invisibly — so the bench never
 * carries a size of its own; it reads the same constants the painters do.
 *
 * Nothing here imports a canvas. The manifest says WHAT goes on each sheet and
 * WHERE the result belongs; `ArtSheets.vue` knows how to paint it.

   * A projectile is the case this exists for. A boss's meteor is a rock inside

   * is to hand them the loop.
   *

   * file rather than from a declaration here, so a design that will not hold
   * for eight panels can come back as four with no code change; and

   * the same clock, so the drop-in never changes the animation's speed.
   *
   * The grid is the walk's — 4 x 2 — because the walk prompt's panel-count
   * discipline was expensive to arrive at and an image model that has been
   * taught "two rows of four" for one sheet should not be asked for a different
