/**
 * ─── Painted animation strips ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A drop-in strip is one image holding N panels side by side, covering exactly
 * one cycle of something that moves — a monster's step, a survivor's stride.
 * The renderer plays it from the same clock that drives the procedural bake, so
 * a design can swap from the drawing to the painting mid-stride without a pop.
 *
 * The frame COUNT is read off the image rather than declared anywhere. Every
 * panel is the procedural frame box scaled up — same proportions by
 * construction — so the number of panels falls out of the strip's own shape.
 * That means eight frames today and sixteen later is a change to the export
 * sheet and to nothing else, and a design that nobody can keep consistent for
 * eight panels can come back as four. A single square image is a one-frame
 * strip, which is how every still in the pipeline gets its fit for free.

 * and shreds the animation, so it is passed by the caller that owns the box
 * rather than guessed at here.
 *
 * Returns null until the bitmap has decoded, which is the whole fallback story:
 * whatever was drawing keeps drawing, and the swap happens when it is ready.
