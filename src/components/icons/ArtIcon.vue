 * A glyph the art pipeline can repaint.

 * Two rungs, best first: the PAINTING at `images/<kind>/<id>.webp` once it
 * exists and the art layer is on, and the shared glyph, which every button
 * falls back to and which is what a fresh clone and a portal build with the
 * flag off both show.
 *
 * Both branches are the component's single root, so a parent's sizing class
 * lands on whichever is showing; the bitmap is `object-fit: contain`, so it
 * sits in the glyph's box rather than stretching to it.
