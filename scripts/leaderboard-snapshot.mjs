/**
 * ─── The baked leaderboard ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Fetches the live board from the Cloudflare Worker and writes it to
 * `data/leaderboard-snapshot.json`, which `vite.config.ts` then ships as the
 * virtual module `virtual:leaderboard-snapshot`.
 *
 * WHY A BUILD-TIME COPY EXISTS AT ALL. Two of the portals forbid the runtime
 * request the board is normally made of — Poki bans every external runtime
 * request outright, and Yandex's moderators reject third-party storage URLs —
 * so both builds ship `VITE_LEADERBOARD_URL` empty and, until now, simply had
 * no leaderboard. A snapshot is not a workaround for those rules: it is inside
 * them. The bytes are part of the bundle, and the game makes no request.
 *
 * WHY THE HISTOGRAM AND NOT JUST THE TOP 100. `/top` publishes 100 rows, and on
 * a board of a few thousand that cut sits around stage 13 — above where a
 * first-session player ever gets. Rows alone could tell 4 % of players where
 * they stand and show the other 96 % "#100+", in exactly the session Poki's fit
 * test grades. So `/top` also carries a histogram of the WHOLE population, and
 * that is what both this snapshot and the live game rank against.
 *
 * Run it by hand before a portal build:
 *
 *     pnpm leaderboard:snapshot
 *
 * The build refreshes it too, but never fails on it — see `readSnapshot`.
